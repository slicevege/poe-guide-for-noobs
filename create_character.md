# Pick a league
Just pick the default one, with bright yellow text reads "__This is the default Path of Exile league__". Don't worry about the other options yet. 

> To reiterate, this guide will keep everything to a minimal to keep you from overwhelmed. If you want some explanations, read here: https://exiledguides.com/home/beginner-guides/beginner-guide-series/part-1/#Leagues
EngineeringEternity has a lot of good guides, highly recommend. 

# Pick a class
Pick the class according to the build you are following. In this case it's Witch. 

> Again, if you want to do some homework, https://exiledguides.com/home/beginner-guides/ is a good source. 

# Follow the tutorial
Follow the tutorial until you defeated Hillock. 

By this point, you may or may not have noticed in PoE, skills are tied to Gems, instead of the character. And the concept of "supporting" and "link" between skill gems. 

Again you can research on it if you find it interesting, but you don't have to think too deep about it now. Just keep in mind this is a very important aspect of the game. 

# Death
You might have died (oops) to the tutorial enemies, Hillock can be a bit tough. 

Be reassured that death doesn't cost anything, until Act 6, which is the second half of the entire story. 

So feel free to experiment and die a lot :D

# Passive tree
By this point the tutorial would have introduced you to the infamous passive tree. 

All you need to do right now, is marvel at its complexity (or not). And carefully put down your first skill point following your chosen build guide. 

## Learnt the wrong passive?
This will be your first encouter with PoE's unforgiving nature. It's not uncommon to learn the "wrong" skill in the passive tree due to various reasons. You can "Refund" the points, but for a price (literally spending currency). 

So really __watch where you are going__ when picking passive skills. 

## Passive tree pathing
Any competent guide will give advice on the which path to take in the tree at different levels. __Follow them carefully__ before you gain good understanding of the game.
