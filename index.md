# What is this guide?
This is a guide for completely noobs, written by a fellow noob. 

Path of Exile is a fantastic game that deserves to be enjoyed by more gamers. But it's also notorious for its extremely unforgiving new player experience. 

This guide hopes to hold your hands until your can run, or be your training wheels while you experience the joy of riding your first bycicle. 

# What this guide is NOT
It does NOT aim to be comprehensive. It focuses on giving you a smooth new player experience, taking you on a journey, without bombarding you with a bazillion pieces of arcane knowledge. 

Since you've decided to dabble in a game like PoE, I assume you have the curious mind to explore on your own and the determination to learn complex mechanics. This guide will NOT remind you about every little details which you can learn by Googling for 30 seconds. 

But still PoE is a complicated beast, you most likely will fail miserably despite your best effort. This guide will try telling you as LITTLE as possible, while keeping you on the safe path, until you have experienced your first PoE journey. 

# So where do I start?
## Pick a build
Always start with a noob friendly build. There are tons of nuances in executing a build properly, which means numerous ways you could fail. It's important to pick a build that's extra forgiving and easy to play. 

## Why picking a noob build is hard?
For example: 
- Require huge investment to be viable. 
- Not enough guidance on leveling: Which skills to level first? Which skill to use? What weapon to choose? Things are obvious to veterans could make noobs scratching their heads. 
- Too hard to level: good end game but miserable leveling for noobs. 
- Mechanically difficult: involving complex mechanics that are hard to grasp. 

## "True" noob friendly builds

Here's the build I will be using as an example throughout the guide: 

[Stress-Free RIGHTEOUS GOLEMS by Wrecker_of_Days](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2936458)
(his guides are AWESOME, highly recommend)

Give whichever build guide you picked a quick read, you don't have to really understand everything for now.
